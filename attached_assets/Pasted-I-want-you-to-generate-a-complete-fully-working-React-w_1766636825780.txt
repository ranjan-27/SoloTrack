I want you to generate a complete, fully working React web application with Firebase integration (Firestore + Authentication). Provide step-by-step instructions and all code for the app to work perfectly, including Firebase setup.

The app should include:

Firebase integration:

Firestore for storing user-specific data (applications)

Authentication for Login and Signup

Login should support OTP (phone authentication) using Firebase Auth that really fetches OTP to mobile

Signup should work normally with email/password

Frontend components/pages (most are already ready, integrate Firebase):

App.jsx (with React Router)

Navbar.jsx (dynamic links based on authentication)

Hero.jsx (landing page)

Dashboard.jsx (statistics, upcoming deadlines, user-specific)

Application.jsx + ViewForm.jsx (CRUD operations, Firestore integrated)

Analytics.jsx (charts: PieChart for status, LineChart for timeline)

Footer.jsx

Login.jsx and Signup.jsx:

Create frontend and backend fully integrated with Firebase Auth

Login should include OTP login via mobile (Firebase Phone Auth)

Signup uses email/password

Provide basic CSS styling for these pages only

Deadline notifications:

Users should get a notification (browser alert or in-app) when application deadlines are near (3 days or less)

Ensure all other existing components work perfectly with Firebase

Include firebase.js configuration, all imports, and hooks so the app works when pasted.

Application form fields: Company, Role, Type, Deadline, Status, Notes (CRUD with Firestore)

Dashboard: Total applications, Pending, Interviews, Offers, Upcoming deadlines

Analytics: Status distribution (PieChart), Timeline (LineChart), Conversion rate

Provide step-by-step instructions for:

Creating a Firebase project

Enabling Firestore

Enabling Authentication (Email/Password + Phone/OTP)

Connecting React app to Firebase

Setting up Firebase OTP verification for Login

Adding deadline notifications

Output: Provide complete code for each component, Firebase config, Login/Signup pages with OTP and CSS, deadline notifications logic, and instructions to run the app successfully. Only Login and Signup pages need CSS; all other components’ frontend is already done.
